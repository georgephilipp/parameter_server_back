# CNN: Caffe on Petuum

Caffe is a deep learning framework originally developed by Yangqing Jia / BVLC
(http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) where GPU was used to speedup the model
training. Here we provide a CPU distributed version of Caffe based on Petuum.
Good speedup and scalability is achieved. We have kept most of the Caffe
interfaces unchanged.

Please consult the [wiki
page](https://github.com/petuum/wiki_staging/wiki/CNN:-Caffe-on-Petuum) for
more details.
