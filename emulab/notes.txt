1. need to use 40gb for topology
2. pdsh having trouble: host key authentication failed. need to find a way to add machiens to known hosts

pdsh -R ssh -w ^machines "/share/probe/bin/linux-panfs -f"

3. notes: when making third party dependecies, there are some packages needs to be installed.. -> need create that in os image

compiler error: /usr/bin/ld not able to find luuid
luuid -> need to install libuuid-dev
lnuma --> libnuma1, libnuma-dev


need to install all dependency listed at bosen installation page:
sudo apt-get -y install g++ make autoconf git libtool uuid-dev openssh-server cmake libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin libssl-dev libnuma-dev python-dev python-numpy python-scipy python-yaml protobuf-compiler subversion libxml2-dev libxslt-dev zlibc zlib1g zlib1g-dev libbz2-1.0 libbz2-dev

did a 'make clean' to fix the problems before installing above packages

possibly need to do a reinstall of bosen?:
         1. run third_party make first

parameter_server build error:
   eigen/dense not found --> change Makefile in the project root directory to use third_party_all
   oprofile doesn't have 'make install' --> removed oprofile from third_party_all
   iftop doesn't have 'make install' --> removed iftop from third_party_all

finished building parameter server. able to run on local machine
however ssh remote execution becomes a problem. seems that such commands are not correctly executed by remote side



------------------------------------
narwhal setup:
sudo mount.panfs panfs://10.25.0.200:global /panfs

set-links
set-link-loss are not usable



useful commands:
pdsh -R ssh -w ^machines "/share/probe/bin/linux-panfs -f"
pdsh -R ssh -w ^machines "sudo mount.panfs panfs://10.25.0.200:global /panfs"
pdsh -R ssh -w ^machines "ifconfig | grep 'inet addr'"
